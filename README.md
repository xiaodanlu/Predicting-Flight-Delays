## Abstract
The airline industry faces the challenge of providing timely services, especially during the holiday season when passenger traffic peaks. This study aims to predict flight delays in December 2022, using data from the US Transportation Department's performance dataset for on-time, delayed, or canceled flights. The project employs machine learning techniques to identify variables contributing to delays and explore patterns in flight performance across airlines, days of the week, and city pairs. Complementary to predictive modeling, Tableau is used to create dashboards and other visualization tools to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the data for both technical and non-technical audiences. The project offers insights that can help airlines optimize their operations, enhance the travel experience for passengers, and promote efficient resource allocation during the busy holiday season.
